# Reproducibility of Results: Radio Wave Techniques for Indoor Positioning Systems

This repository contains the data, scripts, and materials necessary to reproduce the graphs and analyses presented in the article *"A Systematic Review of Radio Wave Techniques for Indoor Positioning Systems."*

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
├── Accuracy_Level_Articles.xlsx           # Table with accuracy levels of analyzed articles
├── capture_technique_count.xlsx           # Data on the count of capture techniques
├── processing_technique_count.xlsx        # Data on the count of processing techniques
├── Gráficos_IEEE.ipynb                    # Python/Colab script to generate graphs
├── README.md                              # This file
```

## File Contents

### 1. **Accuracy_Level_Articles.xlsx**
   - Contains the classification of analyzed articles based on their accuracy levels, categorized as *Low accuracy*, *Accurate*, and *Highly accurate*.
   - Serves as a basis for comparative analysis of the methods.

### 2. **capture_technique_count.xlsx**
   - File with the count of different capture techniques mentioned in the articles.
   - Used to generate graphs on the popularity of these techniques.

### 3. **processing_technique_count.xlsx**
   - Contains data on the processing techniques used in the analyzed articles.
   - Basis for comparative graphs of methodologies.

### 4. **Gráficos_IEEE.ipynb**
   - Jupyter Notebook (Colab) script that generates graphs based on the data provided in the files above.
   - **Requirements:** Python 3.8 or higher and the following libraries:
     - `pandas`
     - `matplotlib`
     - `seaborn`

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```

2. **Load the Data:**
   Ensure that the `.xlsx` files are in the same directory as the notebook `Gráficos_IEEE.ipynb`.

3. **Run the Notebook:**
   - Open the file `Gráficos_IEEE.ipynb` in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or another Jupyter Notebook-compatible environment.
   - Execute the cells sequentially to generate the graphs.

## Generated Results

The graphs generated by the notebook include:
1. **Distribution of Capture Techniques:** Based on the file `capture_technique_count.xlsx`.
2. **Distribution of Processing Techniques:** Based on the file `processing_technique_count.xlsx`.
3. **Accuracy Levels Analysis:** Based on the file `Accuracy_Level_Articles.xlsx`.

The final graphs are exported as PNG files for reproducibility.
